    "# S達o Paulo House Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "House prices are influenced by a variety of factors including location, size, age, condition, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, amenities, and neighborhood. The location of the house is particularly important, as it determines access to transportation, schools, shopping centers, and other amenities. Size and number of bedrooms and bathrooms also play a significant role in determining the price, as larger homes with more rooms are generally more expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the [Kaggle's S達o Paulo House Price dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ex0ticone/house-prices-of-sao-paulo-city) containing information on various features of houses locate in Brazik's S達o Paulo state and their sale prices. Our goal is to get a better understanding of the dataset and identify any patterns or correlations between the features and the target variable (the house price). We will use various visualization techniques and statistical methods to explore the data and gain insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a good understanding of the data, we will move on to training a regression machine learning model on the dataset, and evaluate its performance using various metrics."
